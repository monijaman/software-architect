## What are Distributed Systems?

A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system. These systems coordinate to achieve a common goal while running on multiple machines across different locations.

### Key Benefits
- **Scalability**: Handle increasing load by adding more machines
- **Fault Tolerance**: Continue operating even when some components fail
- **Geographic Distribution**: Serve users from multiple locations with low latency
- **Resource Sharing**: Utilize computing power and storage across multiple machines
- **Parallel Processing**: Execute tasks simultaneously on different machines

### Challenges
- **Network Partitions**: Communication failures between nodes
- **Consistency**: Keeping data synchronized across multiple nodes
- **Concurrency**: Managing simultaneous access to shared resources
- **Fault Detection**: Identifying when components fail
- **Security**: Protecting data and communications across network boundaries

---

## Key Characteristics

### 1. **No Shared Memory**
- Components communicate only through message passing
- Each node has its own local memory and storage
- Requires explicit coordination mechanisms

### 2. **Partial Failures**
- Some components can fail while others continue operating
- Network links can be unreliable or have high latency
- Need to design for graceful degradation

### 3. **Concurrency**
- Multiple processes execute simultaneously
- Race conditions and synchronization challenges
- Need for distributed locking and coordination

### 4. **No Global Clock**
- Cannot rely on synchronized time across all nodes
- Events may appear in different orders on different nodes
- Requires logical clocks and ordering mechanisms

## Core Components

### Load Balancers
**Purpose**: Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers

**Types**:
- **Layer 4 (Transport)**: Routes based on IP and port
- **Layer 7 (Application)**: Routes based on HTTP headers, URLs, cookies

**Algorithms**:
- Round Robin
- Weighted Round Robin
- Least Connections
- IP Hash
- Geographic proximity

**Examples**: AWS Application Load Balancer, NGINX, HAProxy, Cloudflare

### Databases
**Relational Databases (SQL)**
- ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Strong consistency guarantees
- Complex queries with JOINs
- Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server

**NoSQL Databases**
- **Document**: MongoDB, CouchDB
- **Key-Value**: Redis, DynamoDB
- **Column-Family**: Cassandra, HBase
- **Graph**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune

**Database Patterns**:
- **Replication**: Master-Slave, Master-Master
- **Sharding**: Horizontal partitioning of data
- **Federation**: Split databases by function

### Caching
**Levels**:
- **Browser Cache**: Client-side caching
- **CDN**: Geographic content distribution
- **Reverse Proxy**: Server-side caching (Varnish, NGINX)
- **Application Cache**: In-memory caching (Redis, Memcached)
- **Database Cache**: Query result caching

**Patterns**:
- **Cache-Aside**: Application manages cache
- **Write-Through**: Write to cache and database simultaneously
- **Write-Behind**: Write to cache immediately, database asynchronously
- **Refresh-Ahead**: Proactively refresh cache before expiration

### Message Queues
**Purpose**: Asynchronous communication between services

**Types**:
- **Point-to-Point**: One producer, one consumer (Amazon SQS)
- **Publish-Subscribe**: One producer, multiple consumers (Apache Kafka, Redis Pub/Sub)
- **Request-Reply**: Synchronous-style communication over async transport

**Benefits**:
- Decoupling of services
- Better fault tolerance
- Load leveling and buffering
- Scalability improvements

## Design Patterns

### 1. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
**Characteristics**:
- Services communicate via well-defined interfaces
- Platform and language independent
- Services are reusable and autonomous
- Loose coupling between services

**Example**:
```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   User      │    │  Order      │    │  Payment    │
│  Service    │◄──►│  Service    │◄──►│  Service    │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
       │                   │                   │
       └───────────────────┼───────────────────┘
                           ▼
                  ┌─────────────┐
                  │ Inventory   │
                  │  Service    │
                  └─────────────┘
```

### 2. **Microservices Architecture**
**Characteristics**:
- Small, independent services
- Each service owns its data
- API-first communication
- Independent deployment and scaling

**Benefits**:
- Technology diversity
- Independent scaling
- Fault isolation
- Team autonomy

**Challenges**:
- Network complexity
- Data consistency
- Service discovery
- Monitoring and debugging

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
**Characteristics**:
- Components communicate through events
- Loose coupling between producers and consumers
- Asynchronous processing
- Event sourcing and CQRS patterns

**Example Event Flow**:
```
Order Created Event
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  Inventory  │    │   Payment   │    │ Notification│
│   Service   │    │   Service   │    │   Service   │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

### 4. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
**Concept**: Separate read and write operations

**Benefits**:
- Optimize reads and writes independently
- Different data models for queries and commands
- Better scalability for read-heavy workloads

**Implementation**:
```
Commands (Writes)     Events        Queries (Reads)
       │                │                 ▲
       ▼                ▼                 │
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│  Write DB   │  │Event Store  │  │   Read DB   │
│ (Optimized  │  │             │  │ (Optimized  │
│ for writes) │  │             │  │ for reads)  │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

## Common Architectures

### 1. **Three-Tier Architecture**
```
Presentation Tier (Web/Mobile Apps)
        │
Application Tier (Business Logic)
        │
Data Tier (Database)
```

### 2. **N-Tier Architecture**
```
Client ◄──► Load Balancer ◄──► Web Servers ◄──► App Servers ◄──► Database
```

### 3. **Service Mesh Architecture**
```
Service A ◄──► Sidecar Proxy ◄──► Network ◄──► Sidecar Proxy ◄──► Service B
                     │                                  │
                     └────── Control Plane ────────────┘
                           (Service Discovery,
                         Load Balancing, Security)
```

### 4. **Lambda Architecture**
```
Data Sources → Batch Layer (Historical Data)
             └→ Speed Layer (Real-time Data) → Serving Layer → Queries
```
