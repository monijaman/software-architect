## Overview

System design is the core skill that differentiates senior software architects from senior developers. It involves making high-level decisions about system structure, component interactions, data flow, and technology choices that will impact the system for years to come.

### Key Principles
1. **Scalability** - Systems should handle growing load gracefully
2. **Reliability** - Systems should work correctly even when components fail
3. **Availability** - Systems should remain operational and accessible
4. **Consistency** - Data should remain accurate and coherent across the system
5. **Performance** - Systems should respond quickly under normal and peak loads
6. **Maintainability** - Systems should be easy to understand, modify, and extend

### Design Process
1. **Requirements Gathering** - Understand functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Capacity Estimation** - Calculate expected load, storage, and bandwidth needs
3. **System API Design** - Define how clients will interact with the system
4. **High-Level Design** - Create system architecture with major components
5. **Detailed Design** - Deep dive into each component and their interactions
6. **Scale the Design** - Address bottlenecks and scale components horizontally/vertically
7. **Address Edge Cases** - Handle failure scenarios and edge conditions
