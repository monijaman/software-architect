## Style Guide

### Markdown Formatting

#### Headers
```markdown
# H1 - Document Title
## H2 - Major Sections
### H3 - Subsections
#### H4 - Details
```

#### Code Blocks
Use language-specific code blocks:

````markdown
```python
def example():
    return "Hello, World!"
```
````

#### Links
```markdown
[Link Text](https://example.com)
```

#### Lists
```markdown
- Unordered item 1
- Unordered item 2

1. Ordered item 1
2. Ordered item 2
```

#### Emphasis
```markdown
**bold text**
*italic text*
`inline code`
```

### Content Style

#### Writing Style
- Clear and concise language
- Active voice preferred
- Avoid jargon where possible
- Define technical terms when used
- Use examples to illustrate concepts

#### Structure
- Start with overview/introduction
- Use logical progression of topics
- Include practical examples
- Add references at the end
- Use consistent heading levels

#### Code Examples
- Keep examples simple and focused
- Use realistic scenarios
- Include comments for complex logic
- Show both problem and solution
- Use multiple languages when appropriate

#### Diagrams
- Use ASCII art or Mermaid for simple diagrams
- Link to external diagrams for complex visuals
- Include description of the diagram
- Ensure diagrams are clear and readable

Example:
```markdown
## Architecture Diagram
```
Client → API Gateway → Microservices → Database
```
```

### Documentation Standards

#### File Organization
```
docs/
