# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- Understand why decisions were made
- Onboard new team members
- Avoid repeating past mistakes
- Document architectural evolution

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-[NUMBER]: [TITLE]

Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
Include relevant background, constraints, and requirements.

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
Be specific and describe the chosen solution.

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Positive
- List of benefits

### Negative
- List of drawbacks

### Neutral
- Other implications

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated?
Why were they not chosen?

## Example ADR

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use Microservices Architecture

Date: 2025-01-15

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our e-commerce platform has grown significantly with multiple teams working on 
different features. The current monolithic architecture is causing:

- Long deployment cycles (2-3 hours)
- Difficulty scaling individual components
- Teams blocked by dependencies on other teams
- Technology stack limitations (locked into old framework)
- Single point of failure affecting entire system

We need an architecture that supports:
- Independent team development and deployment
- Ability to scale components independently
- Technology flexibility for different services
- Better fault isolation

## Decision
We will migrate from our monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture:

1. Decompose application into services based on business domains:
   - User Service
   - Product Catalog Service
   - Order Service
   - Payment Service
   - Inventory Service
   - Notification Service

2. Services will communicate via:
   - REST APIs for synchronous calls
   - Apache Kafka for asynchronous events

3. Each service will:
   - Have its own database (Database per Service pattern)
   - Be independently deployable
   - Have dedicated team ownership

4. Infrastructure:
   - Kubernetes for orchestration
   - Docker for containerization
   - API Gateway for external access
   - Service mesh (Istio) for inter-service communication

## Consequences

### Positive
- Teams can develop and deploy independently
- Individual services can scale based on demand
- Technology freedom per service
- Better fault isolation (circuit breakers)
- Improved maintainability with smaller codebases
- Easier to understand and onboard for specific services

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for distributed tracing and monitoring
- Data consistency challenges (eventual consistency)
- Network latency between services
- More complex testing (integration and E2E)
- Higher initial development cost
- Requires DevOps expertise and infrastructure

### Neutral
- Teams need to learn new patterns (saga, circuit breaker)
- Migration will be gradual over 6-12 months
- Need for strong API versioning strategy
- Documentation becomes more critical

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Continue with Monolith
**Pros**: No migration effort, simpler operations
**Cons**: Doesn't solve current problems, technical debt continues
**Rejected**: Doesn't meet our scaling and team independence needs

### 2. Modular Monolith
**Pros**: Better organization, easier to migrate to microservices later
**Cons**: Still single deployment unit, doesn't solve independent scaling
**Rejected**: Doesn't provide enough benefits for our scale

### 3. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
**Pros**: Service separation, enterprise service bus for communication
**Cons**: More heavyweight than microservices, ESB can be bottleneck
**Rejected**: Microservices provide better team autonomy

## Best Practices

### 1. Naming Convention
Use sequential numbering: `ADR-001`, `ADR-002`, etc.
Use descriptive titles that capture the essence of the decision.

### 2. When to Write an ADR
Write an ADR when:
- Making architectural decisions that are hard to reverse
- Choosing between significant alternatives
- Adopting new technologies or patterns
- Making trade-offs between competing concerns
- Decisions that affect multiple teams

Don't write an ADR for:
- Trivial decisions
- Implementation details
- Decisions that can be easily changed

### 3. Keep It Concise
- Focus on the decision and its rationale
- Avoid implementation details
- Link to detailed documentation if needed

### 4. Include Context
- Explain the problem clearly
- Document constraints and requirements
- Describe the environment when decision was made

### 5. Document Alternatives
- Show what other options were considered
- Explain why they weren't chosen
- Helps future readers understand trade-offs

### 6. Update Status
- Mark as "Superseded" when replaced by new ADR
- Link to the superseding ADR
- Don't delete old ADRs (they're historical records)

### 7. Review Process
- Have ADRs reviewed by relevant stakeholders
- Discuss trade-offs openly
- Get consensus before marking as "Accepted"

## ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Under Review → Accepted
                ↓
            Rejected
                
Accepted → Deprecated
        → Superseded
```

### States
- **Proposed**: Initial draft, open for discussion
- **Under Review**: Being evaluated by stakeholders
- **Accepted**: Approved and implemented/being implemented
- **Rejected**: Decided not to pursue
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended, but not replaced
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR

## Benefits of ADRs

1. **Historical Record**: Understand past decisions and context
2. **Team Alignment**: Everyone knows why decisions were made

4. **Avoid Rehashing**: Don't revisit settled decisions unnecessarily
5. **Knowledge Sharing**: Capture institutional knowledge
6. **Change Tracking**: See how architecture evolved over time
