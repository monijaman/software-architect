# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-01-15

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to document the architectural decisions made during the development and evolution of our systems. Currently, architectural knowledge is:

- Scattered across code comments, emails, and chat messages
- Stored only in people's heads
- Lost when team members leave
- Difficult for new team members to understand
- Hard to trace the reasoning behind past decisions

Without proper documentation:
- We risk repeating mistakes
- Decisions get re-litigated unnecessarily
- Context for past trade-offs is lost
- Onboarding new team members is slow
- Understanding system evolution is difficult

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document architecturally significant decisions.

An ADR:
- Is a short text document (1-2 pages)
- Describes a single decision
- Uses a consistent template with sections: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
- Is stored in version control with the code
- Is written when the decision is made
- Is immutable once accepted (use new ADR to supersede)

ADRs will be:
- Located in `docs/adr/` directory
- Named sequentially: `0001-title.md`, `0002-title.md`, etc.
- Written in Markdown format
- Reviewed by relevant stakeholders before acceptance
- Indexed in `docs/adr/README.md`

What qualifies as "architecturally significant":
- Decisions that affect structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques
- Choices that are difficult or expensive to reverse
- Technology selections
- Architectural patterns and styles
- Security decisions
- Data management approaches

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Architectural reasoning is documented and preserved
- **Better Onboarding**: New team members can understand decisions and their context
- **Avoid Repetition**: Don't need to re-discuss settled decisions
- **Historical Record**: Track how architecture evolved over time
- **Team Alignment**: Everyone understands and agrees on decisions
- **Transparency**: Decisions and trade-offs are visible to all stakeholders
- **Improved Decision Making**: Forces us to think through decisions more carefully

### Negative
- **Time Investment**: Writing ADRs takes time
- **Maintenance**: Need to keep ADR index updated
- **Discipline Required**: Team needs to commit to writing ADRs consistently
- **Storage**: Additional documentation to maintain

### Neutral
- Team needs to learn ADR format and when to use it
- Need to establish review process for ADRs
- May need tooling support for ADR management
- Need to balance thoroughness with conciseness

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Wiki Documentation
**Pros**: Flexible, easy to edit, searchable
**Cons**: Often becomes outdated, no version control, not close to code
**Rejected**: Too easy to ignore or let become stale

### 2. Code Comments Only
**Pros**: Right next to the code
**Cons**: Limited space, doesn't capture high-level decisions, hard to find
**Rejected**: Insufficient for architectural decisions

### 3. Design Documents
**Pros**: Comprehensive, detailed
**Cons**: Time-consuming, often not maintained, heavyweight process
**Rejected**: Too heavyweight, often ignored after initial creation

### 4. Nothing (Status Quo)
**Pros**: No additional work required
**Cons**: All the problems described in Context
**Rejected**: Doesn't solve our knowledge management issues
