# Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software architecture pattern where the flow of the program is determined by events. Components produce and consume events, enabling loose coupling and asynchronous communication.

## Core Concepts

### Events
- Immutable facts about something that happened
- Contains relevant data about the occurrence
- Examples: "OrderPlaced", "PaymentProcessed", "UserRegistered"

### Event Producers
- Components that generate events
- Publish events to event channels
- Don't know about event consumers

### Event Consumers
- Components that react to events
- Subscribe to event channels
- Process events independently

### Event Channels
- Medium for event transmission
- Can be message queues, event streams, or topics
- Examples: Kafka topics, RabbitMQ queues, AWS SNS

## Types of Event-Driven Patterns

### Event Notification
- Simple notification that something happened
- Minimal data in the event
- Consumers query source for details if needed

### Event-Carried State Transfer
- Event contains all necessary data
- Consumers don't need to query back
- Reduces coupling and network calls

### Event Sourcing
- Store all state changes as events
- Current state derived from event history
- Complete audit trail

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Separate models for reads and writes
- Often combined with event sourcing
- Optimized queries and commands

## Benefits

### Loose Coupling
- Producers and consumers are independent
- Easy to add new consumers
- No direct dependencies

### Scalability
- Independent scaling of producers and consumers
- Parallel event processing
- Better resource utilization

### Flexibility
- Easy to add new features by adding consumers
- No changes to producers required
- Dynamic system evolution

### Real-Time Processing
- Immediate reaction to events
- Streaming data processing
- Low latency

### Resilience
- Consumers can fail independently
- Event replay capability
- Better fault tolerance

## Challenges

### Complexity
- Distributed system challenges
- Difficult to debug and trace
- Complex error handling

### Eventual Consistency
- Data consistency across services
- Dealing with out-of-order events
- Compensating transactions

### Event Schema Evolution
- Managing event format changes
- Backward and forward compatibility
- Versioning strategy needed

### Monitoring and Debugging
- Tracking event flows
- Distributed tracing required
- Complex troubleshooting

## Implementation Patterns

### Publish-Subscribe
```
Publisher → Topic → Multiple Subscribers
```
- One event consumed by multiple subscribers
- Broadcast pattern
- Each subscriber gets a copy

### Point-to-Point
```
Producer → Queue → Single Consumer
```
- Each message consumed by one consumer
- Work distribution
- Load balancing

### Event Streaming
```
Producers → Event Log → Consumers
```
- Ordered sequence of events
- Event replay capability
- Apache Kafka model

## Best Practices

### 1. Event Design
- Make events immutable
- Include event metadata (timestamp, ID, version)
- Use clear, descriptive event names
- Keep events focused and cohesive

### 2. Schema Management
- Use schema registry
- Version your events
- Ensure backward compatibility

### 3. Error Handling
- Implement retry logic
- Dead letter queues for failed events
- Idempotent event processing

### 4. Monitoring
- Track event flow metrics
- Monitor consumer lag
- Implement distributed tracing
- Alert on processing failures

### 5. Testing
- Unit test event handlers
- Integration test event flows
- Test with event replay
- Chaos engineering

### 6. Documentation
- Document event schemas
- Describe event flows
- Maintain event catalog

## Use Cases

### Real-Time Analytics
- User behavior tracking
- Clickstream analysis
- Real-time dashboards

### Notification Systems
- Email/SMS notifications
- Push notifications
- Alert systems

### Workflow Orchestration
- Order processing
- Approval workflows
- Multi-step processes

### Data Synchronization
- Cache invalidation
- Search index updates
- Data replication

### IoT Applications
- Sensor data processing
- Device management
- Real-time monitoring

- **Kafka Streams**: Stream processing with Kafka

## Example: E-Commerce Order Processing

```
User Places Order
       │
       v
┌─────────────────┐
│ OrderService    │
│ Publishes:      │
│ "OrderPlaced"   │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴─────┬──────────┬──────────────┐
    v          v          v              v
┌────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌─────────┐
│Inventory│ │Payment  │ │Shipping  │ │Analytics│
│Service │ │Service  │ │Service   │ │Service  │
└────┬───┘ └────┬────┘ └────┬─────┘ └─────────┘
     │          │            │
     v          v            v
  Reserve    Process     Schedule
  Items      Payment     Delivery
     │          │            │
     └──────────┴────────────┘
                │
                v
         Order Fulfilled
```

## Event Example

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_12345",
  "eventType": "OrderPlaced",
  "eventVersion": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "aggregateId": "order_67890",
  "data": {
    "orderId": "order_67890",
    "customerId": "cust_123",
    "items": [
      {
        "productId": "prod_456",
        "quantity": 2,
        "price": 29.99
      }
    ],
    "totalAmount": 59.98,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "corr_abc123",
    "causationId": "cmd_xyz789",
    "userId": "user_123"
  }
}
```

## When to Use Event-Driven Architecture

### Good Fit
- Real-time data processing requirements
- Multiple systems need to react to same events
- Microservices architecture
- IoT and sensor data
- Audit trail requirements

### Not Recommended
- Simple CRUD applications
- Synchronous request-response patterns sufficient
- Strong consistency required everywhere
- Limited team experience with distributed systems
