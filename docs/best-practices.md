# Software Architecture Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines best practices that software architects should follow to create robust, maintainable, and scalable systems.

## Design Best Practices

### 1. Start with Requirements
- Understand functional requirements clearly
- Identify non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security)
- Document constraints (budget, time, technology)
- Prioritize requirements

### 2. Design for Change
- Anticipate future changes
- Use loose coupling and high cohesion
- Apply SOLID principles
- Favor composition over inheritance

### 3. Keep It Simple
- Avoid over-engineering
- Use well-known patterns
- Prefer simple solutions
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

### 4. Document Decisions
- Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Maintain architecture diagrams
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Keep documentation up-to-date

### 5. Design for Failure
- Assume components will fail
- Implement retry logic and circuit breakers
- Use timeouts appropriately
- Plan for degraded functionality

## Code Quality

### 1. Code Reviews
- Review all code before merging
- Use pull request templates
- Automated checks (linting, testing)
- Focus on design and architecture in reviews

### 2. Automated Testing
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)

### 3. Continuous Integration
- Automate build and test processes
- Run tests on every commit
- Fast feedback loops
- Fail fast principle

### 4. Code Standards
- Consistent coding style
- Use linters and formatters
- Follow language-specific conventions
- Document complex logic

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security
- Don't rely on single security measure
- Validate at every layer
- Assume external input is malicious

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Minimum necessary permissions
- Role-based access control
- Regular permission audits
- Temporary elevated access only

### 3. Input Validation
- Validate all user input
- Sanitize data before use
- Use parameterized queries
- Whitelist over blacklist

### 4. Secure Communication
- Use TLS/SSL for data in transit
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Secure key management
- Regular security updates

### 5. Authentication & Authorization
- Strong password policies
- Multi-factor authentication
- Token-based authentication (JWT)
- Session management
- OAuth 2.0 for third-party access

## Performance Best Practices

### 1. Measure First, Optimize Later
- Profile before optimizing
- Focus on bottlenecks
- Set performance budgets
- Monitor production performance

### 2. Database Optimization
- Index frequently queried columns
- Optimize query patterns
- Use connection pooling
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads

### 3. Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement cache invalidation
- Use appropriate TTL values
- Consider multiple cache layers
- Monitor cache hit rates

### 4. Asynchronous Processing
- Use message queues for long operations
- Non-blocking I/O where possible
- Background job processing
- Event-driven architecture

### 5. Resource Management
- Properly close connections and resources
- Use connection pooling
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor resource usage

## Scalability Best Practices

### 1. Horizontal Scaling
- Design for stateless services
- Use load balancers
- Implement session management
- Database sharding for data scaling

### 2. Microservices Considerations
- Clear service boundaries
- Independent deployment
- Decentralized data management
- API versioning strategy

### 3. Caching and CDN
- Use CDN for static assets
- Application-level caching
- Database query caching
- Edge computing where appropriate

### 4. Database Scaling
- Read replicas for read scaling
- Sharding for write scaling
- Consider NoSQL for specific use cases
- Implement proper indexing

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Logging
- Structured logging
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Include correlation IDs
- Avoid logging sensitive data

### 2. Metrics
- Track key performance indicators
- System metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application metrics (request rate, latency, errors)
- Business metrics

### 3. Tracing
- Distributed tracing for microservices
- Track request flows
- Identify bottlenecks
- Tools: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry

### 4. Alerting
- Alert on actionable issues
- Define clear SLOs and SLIs
- Escalation policies
- Avoid alert fatigue
- Runbooks for common issues

### 5. Health Checks
- Implement liveness probes
- Implement readiness probes
- Monitor dependencies
- Regular health check intervals

## DevOps Best Practices

### 1. Infrastructure as Code
- Version control infrastructure
- Terraform, CloudFormation, or similar
- Reproducible environments
- Automated provisioning

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated builds
- Automated testing
- Automated deployments
- Rollback capabilities
- Blue-green or canary deployments

### 3. Containerization
- Docker for packaging
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Consistent environments
- Easy scaling

### 4. Version Control
- Git for source control
- Meaningful commit messages
- Feature branches
- Code review process
- Semantic versioning

### 5. Environment Management
- Separate dev, staging, production
- Production-like staging
- Environment parity
- Configuration management

## Documentation Best Practices

- System architecture overview
- Component interactions
- Data flow diagrams
- Deployment diagrams

### 2. API Documentation
