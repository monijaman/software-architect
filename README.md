## Architecture Patterns

### Layered (N-tier) Architecture
- Organizes system into layers with specific responsibilities
- Common layers: Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access, Database
- Benefits: Separation of concerns, maintainability, testability

### Microservices Architecture
- Decomposes application into small, independent services
- Each service is self-contained and handles specific business capability
- Benefits: Scalability, flexibility, technology diversity
- Challenges: Distributed system complexity, data consistency

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Components communicate through events
- Loose coupling between producers and consumers
- Benefits: Scalability, flexibility, real-time processing
- Use cases: Real-time analytics, IoT, notification systems

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
- Core business logic isolated from external dependencies
- Adapters handle communication with external systems
- Benefits: Testability, maintainability, technology independence

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Separates read and write operations
- Different models for commands and queries
- Benefits: Performance optimization, scalability
- Often combined with Event Sourcing

### Event Sourcing
- Stores state changes as sequence of events
- Current state derived from event history
- Benefits: Audit trail, temporal queries, event replay

### Serverless Architecture
- Functions as a Service (FaaS) model
- Infrastructure managed by cloud provider
- Benefits: Cost efficiency, auto-scaling, reduced operational overhead

## Design Principles

### SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- A class should have only one reason to change
- Each module/class should have one well-defined responsibility

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Software entities should be open for extension, closed for modification
- Use abstraction and polymorphism to extend behavior

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
- Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- Create specific interfaces rather than general-purpose ones

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Both should depend on abstractions

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Avoid code duplication
- Extract common functionality into reusable components

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Simplicity should be a key goal in design
- Avoid unnecessary complexity

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Don't add functionality until it's necessary
- Avoid speculative features

### Separation of Concerns
- Different aspects of software should be separated
- Each component should address a specific concern

### Principle of Least Knowledge (Law of Demeter)
- Objects should have limited knowledge about other objects
- Only talk to immediate friends

## System Design

### Scalability

#### Horizontal Scaling
- Adding more machines to the pool
- Load balancing across multiple servers
- Better fault tolerance

#### Vertical Scaling
- Adding more resources to existing machines
- Simpler but has physical limits

#### Caching Strategies
- Client-side caching
- CDN caching
- Application-level caching (Redis, Memcached)
- Database caching

### High Availability

#### Load Balancing
- Distribute traffic across multiple servers
- Algorithms: Round-robin, Least connections, IP hash

#### Redundancy
- Active-active configuration
- Active-passive configuration
- Database replication

#### Failover Mechanisms
- Automatic detection and recovery
- Health checks and monitoring

### Data Management

#### Database Selection
- Relational databases (SQL): ACID compliance, complex queries
- NoSQL databases: Scalability, flexibility
  - Document stores (MongoDB)
  - Key-value stores (Redis)
  - Column-family stores (Cassandra)
  - Graph databases (Neo4j)

#### Data Partitioning (Sharding)
- Horizontal partitioning across multiple databases
- Partition strategies: Range, Hash, Directory-based

#### Database Replication
- Master-slave replication
- Master-master replication
- Read replicas for scaling reads

### API Design

#### RESTful APIs
- Resource-based URLs
- HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
- Stateless communication
- Proper status codes

#### GraphQL
- Client-specified queries
- Single endpoint
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching

#### gRPC
- High-performance RPC framework
- Protocol Buffers
- Bi-directional streaming

### Message Queues
- Asynchronous communication
- Decoupling services
- Popular systems: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, AWS SQS

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Logging
- Centralized logging systems
- Structured logging
- Log levels and retention policies

#### Metrics
- System metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Application metrics (request rate, latency)
- Business metrics

#### Tracing
- Distributed tracing
- Request flow visualization
- Tools: Jaeger, Zipkin

#### Alerting
- Proactive monitoring
- Alert thresholds and escalation

## Best Practices

### Security

#### Authentication and Authorization
- OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect
- JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- TLS/SSL certificates
- Key management

#### Input Validation
- Sanitize user input
- Prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, CSRF)

#### API Security
- API keys and rate limiting
- CORS policies
- API gateway

### Performance Optimization

#### Database Optimization
- Query optimization and indexing
- Connection pooling
- Denormalization when appropriate

#### Caching
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Cache invalidation strategies
- TTL (Time To Live) settings

#### Code Optimization
- Efficient algorithms and data structures
- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile and measure

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- High code coverage

#### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- API contract testing

#### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows
- Automated UI testing

#### Performance Testing
- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Capacity planning

## Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made during project development.

### ADR Template
